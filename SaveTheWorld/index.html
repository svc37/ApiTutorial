            We probably won't need to call this stuff in the html page ever.  This is just for testing/practice purposes.
            Also this is only displaying a really small part of the result.  Feel free to bring in more from the "result"
            or display it differently.  I just wanted you to see that the call worked. 
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red">I have the local host hard coded in the function.  Change it to yours!</span>
            <br />
            If you want to see the entire returned dataset you can debug this bitch and set your break point on line 51 
            of the LeagueApiController and hover over the "json" variable. Click on the little arrow looking things to expand
            the data.
